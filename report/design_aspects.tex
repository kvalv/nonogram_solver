\subsection*{iterated filtering}
Some tweaks were added to the function \texttt{generate\_children} of the solver.
The function takes in a state $S = (X,Y)$ where $X$ represent the row
candidates and $Y$ represent the column candidates. For each row $x \in X$, we
filter the columns $y_i \in Y$ based on the common indices of $x$. For example,
if we define the entry $x_1$ as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_1[0] = $\texttt{[1,0,0,1]}
    \item $x_1[1] = $\texttt{[1,0,1,0]}
\end{itemize}

Then we know for sure that any candidate in $x_1$ must have the entries \texttt{[1,0,?,?]}
because they are common in all candidates.  We filter out all columns in $y_0$
and $y_1$ where their value do not agree. This will do the transformation
$y_1 \to y_1'$ where $y_1'$ is the set of candidates in $y_1$ that satisfies the
common cells from $x_1$. We can next filter the different $x_i
\in X$ based on the 'reduced set' $Y' = [y_1', y_2, ...]$. This procedure can
be applied iteratively until we have a set $Y^*$ that does not change when
filtered on the corresponding set $X^*$ and vice versa. This greatly increased
the processing speed of the model.
