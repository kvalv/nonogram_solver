\subsection*{Successor generation}
Given a node, fetch the state and try to move all cars in all possible
directions that is still considered valid. A valid move is a move where no car
intersect or move outside of the board. Each of these car movements generate a new state,
and there is a new node generated for each of these new states. If the new state has been
encountered befre (the algorithm keeps track of all known states), then the new node
will inherit the same parent, $f$, $g$ and $h$-value as the already-existing node.
The parent node will append the new nodes as its children.
